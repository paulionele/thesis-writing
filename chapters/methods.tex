\chapter{Simulations}

A simulation is intended to imitate---in many cases---a real-world process or system. Before any such simulation can begin, a model of the system studied must be constructed. In general, a model should be as simple as possible while still explaining experimental observations and make predictions with a given degree of accuracy. Models contain key characteristics and behaviours of the system they represent and the simulation is the implementation of the model intended for testing, analysis, and/or visual presentation. 





\section{1-Dimensional Systems}
In 1D, homogenous and heterogeneous simple cell systems were simulated using Monte Carlo (MC) and finite difference approaches.
